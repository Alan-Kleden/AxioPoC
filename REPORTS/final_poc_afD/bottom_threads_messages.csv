100016682,-0.34419292,0,*VOTE: How is 21st-century classical music imaginary?
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"*VOTE --- I'm guessing that Wahoofive thinks that a large number of hits is meaningless because both ""contemporary"" and ""classical"" are common words. However. If you search ''as a phrase'', you still get over 100,000 hits, and many seem to describe a genre. Also if you Google for the individual composers described in the article, you will find hundreds of articles for each one describing them as ""contemporary classical"". ----"
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"**[[WP:NPA|Please don't make personal attacks]]. For your information, I'm a music professional and am very familiar with all the composers mentioned in the article. They just don't have anything in common other than being alive in the 21st century.&mdash;"
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"**P.S. the merge to [[Contemporary classical music]], mentioned below, seems reasonable.&mdash;"
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"*<strike>VOTE</strike> (vote changed to VOTE) - I fail to understand your reasoning that googling is useless. Google ""Contemporary classical"". --<i>"
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"*VOTE:  The reason the Google test is irrelevant is that ""contemporary"" as an adjective applied to ""Classical"" as an adjective is going to generation bazillions of hits for ""contemporary recording of classical music"" and ""contemporary classical recording,"" etc.  I.e. it's not going to reveal a ''genre.''  So that's that.  As for the reason for deletion, the term is an oxymoron.  See [[Classical music]]:  the term refers to a particular type of serious music, not all serious music.  I.e. there is [[Romantic music]], [[Baroque music]], [[Classical music]], [[minimalist music]], [[serialist music]], [[abstract music]], etc., all of which are called, by people who don't study music, ""classical music.""  So, is there a neo-Classicism movement underway right now that is a genre?  If so, it has entirely escaped the notice of the music press."
100016682,-0.34419292,0,"::Also, if you look at the google search for ""contemporary classical"" [http://www.google.com/search?q=%22contemporary+classical%22+&hl=en&lr=&client=firefox-a&rls=org.mozilla:en-US:official&start=10&sa=N] you will see that the word after ""contemporary classical"" is almost without fail ""music"" or some adjective that modifies ""music"". The point I'm trying to make is that this ''is'' a genre. Also, I don't think that most people know that there's a difference between ""romantic"", ""baroque"" and ""classical"", and they group them all under ""classical"" - that seems to be what's going on with this term: if symphonic instruments are used in music, we call it ""classical"" --<i>"
100016682,-0.34419292,0,*VOTE - Adding an adjective to a noun does not always result in an actual subject.

100110029,-0.31281808,0,"*<s>'''Comment'''</s> '''Keep''' What exactly are the notability guidelines for musical productions? I'm familiar with [[WP:MUSIC]] but that applies to people or groups, rather than theatrical productions. This musical had a notable star, and there are links to non-trivial coverage in The Sun and The Stage, which is probably enough to '''keep''' this, unless there are specific guidelines suggesting that isn't enough."
100110029,-0.31281808,0,":To me, simply having a production somewhere that had a notable actor does not make the musical notable -- the actor could very well have done it some time before he or she was famous, or, conversely, on the way down the ladder and that was all the work he or she could get.  But, like I said, the main reason for nominating so many was to see what everyone else thinks, then maybe get some guidelines together for inclusion in [[WP:NOTE]].  So, my suggestion would be to vote your conscience.... &mdash; &nbsp;"
100110029,-0.31281808,0,"::*By your own criteria (#1 ''the musical achieved any production whatsoever in... London''), this musical ''is'' notable. It achieved a production in central London (it says London in the second line). If it's notable by your own criteria, you appear to be contradicting yourself by nominating it as non-notable. Until a specific [[WP:N]] guideline for musical productions is introduced we should just use the general guidline, ie significant coverage in reliable sources, which is taken care of by The Sun and The Stage articles (and a few others), so I'd recommend keeping this as before."
100110029,-0.31281808,0,":::Perhaps I should have added ""that aren't a holiday-time flop"".  The article basically says that it played for a month and no one went to see it.  This deserves inclusion in WP? &mdash; &nbsp;"
100110029,-0.31281808,0,"::Your criteria fail [[WP:BIAS|Wikipedia's policy to counter systemic bias]]. A musical is not non-notable just because it hasn't played in an English-speaking country, and favouring US and UK productions over those of other countries is also biased. --"
100110029,-0.31281808,0,:::Are you really saying that a musical that achieved three performances in a random small town in Siberia deserve inclusion?&mdash; &nbsp;
100110029,-0.31281808,0,"::::And those conventions come from US and UK musical theatre, which is not the entire story. --"
